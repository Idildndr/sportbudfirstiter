SportBud is a social app that connects individuals for workouts. Users can discover or host events such as running or yoga. They can either participate in an existing room or create a new one. Using the map view, users can pin the activity room location or locate an existing room. Other users can see upcoming workout events on the map or search for an activity room. The event room includes a Chat Screen and lists other participants. Every user has Loyalty Points and Fair Play Points. Room participants vote on Personal Points for each other after events using the Vote screen. Users also have a Profile Screen that displays event history and Personal Points.
